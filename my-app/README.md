redux tool kit

1. to create store we need to import configureStore from reduxjs/toolkit
2. inside store we can create reducers
3. add provider store and wrap it under app component which helps us to access the store to entire application
4. use createSlice to create reducer functions and use useSelector to get and useDispatch to update.
